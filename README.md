# Dokan Product Duplicator

Instantly copy a WooCommerce product from a vendor on Dokan powered multivendor marketplace

## Description

> This plugin is made to work with [**Dokan Lite**](https://wordpress.org/plugins/dokan-lite/) and [**Paid Version of Dokan**](http://wedevs.com/theme/dokan/?utm_source=wporg&utm_medium=cta&utm_campaign=dokan-product-duplicator). So you must install Dokan before installing this plugin.

Suppose, John is selling potato chips; Sam found out that and he thinks that he can sell that product too. And maybe he can sell flavoured ones like tomato, paprika and cheese. But writing the product description again for the same product is quite time-consuming. So what if he can copy all those data at one click, add an image and spin up the text a little bit and publish right away? Yes, now it is possible!

Product Duplicator adds a button “Add To My Store” to any single product page which copies all the information including the product pictures and goes directly into an add new product page using all the previous data filled in. Now, edit it as you need and you are done!

You can also create dummy products for common items like cookies, soap, even groceries. This add-on can give your sellers a quick start. They can start selling a new product with just a click.

It is as simple as that! Install this add-on and help you sellers to get smart.
